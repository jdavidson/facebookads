# Facebook Ads
LookML files for a Facebook block compatible with [Stitch](https://www.stitchdata.com/integrations/facebook-ads/).

To use this block, you will need to:

1. Replace the connection name in the model file or create a facebook_connection user_attribute.
2. Replace the schema name in each view file with your Facebook integration's schema name or create a facebook_schema user_attribute.
